When it comes to writing code, I think there's one thing that can make a big difference in how good your software is: sticking to coding standards. It's like having a set of rules that help you write code in a way that's easy to understand, not just for you but for anyone else who might read it later. And you know what? I believe following these standards can actually help you get better at coding, especially when you're trying to learn a new programming language.

Many programming languages are kind of similar. They have classes, functions, and they care about how you indent your lines to show what belongs together. Once you get the hang of these patterns, learning another language becomes a lot easier. That's where coding standards come in. They're like a guide that helps you understand these patterns, making it easier to pick up new languages along the way.

In the real world as a software engineer, you're likely going to write more complex code and work with a group of people. It's not just about simplifying your own work. When you write code that sticks to these rules, it's like you're writing a clear message to the next person who reads it. They'll be able to understand what you were thinking, fix things if they need to, or use your code in their own project. It's all about teamwork, and good coding standards are the secret sauce that makes it work.

While using ESLint with IntelliJ, I found my experience to be a bit annoying at first. At first, it felt like ESLint was just waiting to catch me out, pointing out every little mistake. It was annoying to get all these errors about things I hadn't even finished writing yet. But as time went on, I started to see it differently. Before I used to be very lazy with my coding and just focused on the end goal, making my code work regardless of the format of my code. After using ESLint I realized that it was helping me write better code, one green checkmark at a time. Fixing those errors and seeing that green checkmark is quite satisfying. So, what started out as something annoying turned into something that actually made me a better coder.

Coding standards might seem like just another set of rules, but they're more than that. They're a way to make your code better, learn new stuff easier, and work well with others. Getting used to tools like ESLint? It might be tough at first, but it's totally worth it in the end.
