### I. Introduction


AI is everywhere in this day of age and sometimes frowned upon. I remember back when applications such as ChatGPT were new and news articles would be disapproved of since so many students were using it to write essays and other assignments instead of the student manually doing it. There are even AI detectors invented to detect whether the essay was written by a student or AI. Despite these concerns, there is the potential of AI to improve our lives. As we face its challenge, we would need to use AI wisely. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

  2. In-class Practice WODs

  3. In-class WODs

  4. Essays

  5. Final project

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

Using AI was a double edged sword. At times it helped my learning like breaking down complex topics and made it easier to understand. But other times, when I get lazy and in a time crunch I lean on it too much so I can get assignments done right away. However this is not good as it hinders my learning. When I skip the struggle and hard work of figuring things out myself, I don’t get to practice solving problems on my own, which I think is an important skill to learn. 


### IV. Practical Applications:

Outside 314, I found that AI is very helpful for everyday tasks such as using Google Maps to find the best route, getting recommendations while online shopping, and using voice assistants such as Siri. These tools help me stay organized and make decisions quickly. It shows how integrated AI has become in enhancing everyday life. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

One big challenge I've faced with using AI is the temptation to depend on it too much. It's really easy to let AI handle tasks for me instead of doing them myself, especially when it saves time. But I've noticed that this can actually slow down my learning. This reliance on AI, while convenient, can end up being a major drawback as it interferes with my true learning and long-term ability to solve problems independently.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

I believe that traditional teaching methods like lectures and textbooks are solid but can be unengaging. In contrast, AI learning tools use interactive elements like games and instant feedback to keep students interested and help them remember information better. Although it can be helpful, I don’t think AI should replace traditional teaching methods. The direct engagement between the students and instructors encourages a more personal connection that can be crucial for student motivation and emotional support. AI cannot replicate that. 

### VII. Future Considerations:

A significant area for improvement is the problem of deepfakes. . As AI gets better at creating realistic but fake images and videos, it's important for students to learn about the ethical challenges it poses. It is important to teach how to handle AI’s impacts responsibly, like preventing the misuse of deepfakes. Including lessons on ethics and tools to detect fake content can help prepare students to use AI wisely and responsibly in the real world.

### VIII. Conclusion:

While AI offers great benefits, I think it should be used as a tool instead of abusing it. Depending too much on AI is like a crash course headed for disaster. In our software engineering course, finding the right balance is key. AI should help us learn, not do all the work for us. We can make the most of AI's help while still growing our own skills effectively.
