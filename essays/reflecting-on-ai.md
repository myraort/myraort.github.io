### I. Introduction

AI is everywhere in this day of age and sometimes frowned upon. I remember back when applications such as ChatGPT were new and news articles would be disapproved of since so many students were using it to write essays and other assignments instead of the student manually doing it. There are even AI detectors invented to detect whether the essay was written by a student or AI. Despite these concerns, there is the potential of AI to improve our lives. As we face its challenge, we would need to use AI wisely. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I did not use AI for the experience WODs since whenever I do get stuck or DNF, I prefer watching the Youtube videos from the professor to see where I went wrong and then attempt to solve the WODs again on my own.

2. In-class Practice WODs

I used AI for in-class practice WODs if I am running out of time or if I’m desperately in need of help. For example, I utilize ChatGPT for styling since there are many styling components used in bootstrap.

3. In-class WODs

I usually don’t like working in time-sensitive/high-pressure situations. Since in-class WODs were 100 points all or nothing I used it more as a safety backup. Whenever I am in a time crunch and or if I have some bugs and I don’t know how to fix them I would depend on it often. 

4. Essays

This semester, I've used AI to help with my essays, especially for checking spelling mistakes and coming up with creative titles. I often struggle to think of engaging titles on my own, so turning to AI for suggestions has been really helpful.

5. Final project

For our project I did use AI. I was not too familiar with backend so I usually asked ChatGPT to help me out. I heavily used open resources such as libraries to implement React Bootstrap components such as cards and buttons. This taught me a lot about looking things up the right way and to learn and solve problems efficiently.

6. Learning a concept / tutorial
   
I used AI like ChatGPT to help me although like mentioned above, I prefer being able to ask smart questions and being able to look things up on my own. I am also a visual learner, I find that watching Youtube tutorials online aligns better with my learning style. 

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

I did not use AI for answering questions in class or on discord since most of the questions I had were administrative questions.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question

I did not use AI for asking or answering a smart question since most of the questions I had were already answered in the discord ‘smart-questions’ channel. I believe that it is a necessary skill to learn how to come up and ask a smart question rather than asking AI to do it for you.

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

Yes, AI helped me improve my understanding of concepts. I remember using it a lot the first few weeks when we had to cram learning Javascript, ESLint, and Underscore.

10. Explaining code

Yes, I used ChatGPT to explain code although I noticed that ChatGPT can be quite vague. It really just gives a broad overview of what the code does which can be helpful for a general understanding but it often skips over the nitty gritty pieces.

11. Writing code

Yes, I used ChatGPT for writing code especially when working with React components that subscribe to and fetch client data from a Meteor server. It can be very repetitive since it uses the same structure over and over again. I found that using ChatGPT helped me cut down my time and focus more on the unique aspects of the project. 

12. Documenting code

No, I did not use AI to document my code. Halfway into this project, I lost my habit of documenting code which is not good and something I should do more often. 

13. Quality assurance 

I did not find it necessary to use AI like ChatGPT since IntelliJ integrates tools like ESLint. When I hover over errors, it usually tells me what's wrong and suggests how I can fix them.

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

I did not use AI for anything that has not yet been mentioned above for ICS 314.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

Using AI was a double edged sword. At times it helped my learning like breaking down complex topics and made it easier to understand. But other times, when I get lazy and in a time crunch I lean on it too much so I can get assignments done right away. However this is not good as it hinders my learning. When I skip the struggle and hard work of figuring things out myself, I don’t get to practice solving problems on my own, which I think is an important skill to learn. 


### IV. Practical Applications:

Outside 314, I found that AI is very helpful for everyday tasks such as using Google Maps to find the best route, getting recommendations while online shopping, and using voice assistants such as Siri. These tools help me stay organized and make decisions quickly. It shows how integrated AI has become in enhancing everyday life. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

One big challenge I've faced with using AI is the temptation to depend on it too much. It's really easy to let AI handle tasks for me instead of doing them myself, especially when it saves time. But I've noticed that this can actually slow down my learning. This reliance on AI, while convenient, can end up being a major drawback as it interferes with my true learning and long-term ability to solve problems independently.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

I believe that traditional teaching methods like lectures and textbooks are solid but can be unengaging. In contrast, AI learning tools use interactive elements like games and instant feedback to keep students interested and help them remember information better. Although it can be helpful, I don’t think AI should replace traditional teaching methods. The direct engagement between the students and instructors encourages a more personal connection that can be crucial for student motivation and emotional support. AI cannot replicate that. 

### VII. Future Considerations:

A significant area for improvement is the problem of deepfakes. . As AI gets better at creating realistic but fake images and videos, it's important for students to learn about the ethical challenges it poses. It is important to teach how to handle AI’s impacts responsibly, like preventing the misuse of deepfakes. Including lessons on ethics and tools to detect fake content can help prepare students to use AI wisely and responsibly in the real world.

### VIII. Conclusion:

While AI offers great benefits, I think it should be used as a tool instead of abusing it. Depending too much on AI is like a crash course headed for disaster. In our software engineering course, finding the right balance is key. AI should help us learn, not do all the work for us. We can make the most of AI's help while still growing our own skills effectively.
