The first time I’ve been introduced to software engineering was on Youtube. There was a time that it became trendy and the dream job, I was captivated by the discussion surrounding it.  Initially, I always thought that when you become a software engineer, all you do is code. Although this is mostly true, the role of a software engineer involves various tasks and responsibilities beyond just coding. Software engineering is the process of developing and designing things to make it into reality. 

## Starting from Scratch ##

An aspect of software engineering that I found interesting was making things from scratch. I was blown away by the fact that you can make a website on your own! Software engineers can take ideas or challenges and turn them into reality or a solution to a problem. They always strive to innovate and look for ways to efficiently get things done. As technology keeps advancing, software engineers usually keep up to date with the latest technological advancements and trends. It’s astounding that they’re able to keep up and adapt to new ideas. 

## The Near Future ##

Now that I’m starting out, I hope to develop my coding skills and learn new languages. Although picking up new programming languages might be challenging, it will be a valuable experience that opens up more opportunities. I also want to learn more about how to build good software and work on real projects. Although I have a lot to learn, I plan to take it one step at a time.
