### To the Moon! ###



In my second semester of college, I was part of a student-lead research group led by Ashten Akemoto and worked with Jared Lo, Joy Miyazaki, and Kenoi Salvadori. Autonomous robotics is helpful to develop infrastructure and explore planets. Unfortunately, algorithms that run to help robots to localize, plan, and control are way too expensive. This project was about the development of a cooperative rover fleet for moon exploration. More specifically, implementing a multi-agent transfer visual teach and repeat algorithm (VTR) for robots in heterogeneous systems.

We were divided into two groups focusing on software and hardware. Joy and Kenoi took charge of the hardware components, while Jared and I worked on the software aspects. Our main task in the software group was to develop the application’s camera functionality. This required us to learn ROS (Robot Operating Systems), an open source framework for writing robotic software. Learning it was challenging but a fun experience, we also used Ubuntu as our operating system. We were also tasked to learn scripting languages such as Bash. We also used Docker which involved running server scripts and managing containers. I was tasked with creating a URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to match the dimensions of the CubeRover we were working on and to use RViz to visually see and verify if the model’s components were aligned correctly. 

 ### What I've Learned ###
 
Looking back, I would say that Ashten really made us explore different avenues of this project, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with new approaches. This project broadened my horizons in both software and hardware. I gained many valuable experiences in software aspects and a bit in hardware as well. I learned key skills such as teamwork, effective communication, and working under tight deadlines. Overall, this project was an enjoyable experience and seeing the outcome of what we all put in is something that I’ll never forget.
