## Project Overview

The project ‘Imi Invasive is a web application that aims to help track and manage invasive species across the Hawaiian Islands. The application is designed to provide a platform for users to report sightings of invasive species, which can then be used to monitor and manage these species effectively. The application also provides information on invasive species, their impact on the ecosystem, and ways to prevent their spread.

‘Imi Invasive aims to address invasive species management challenges by establishing a citizen science initiative to bring the community together and educate people on invasive species, raising awareness and empowering the community and professionals to be able to better track the harmful species and care for the ecosystem. It should serve as an educational resource and also a centralized app for people to report and help manage invasive species across the Hawaiian Islands.

## Personal Contributions
 
For this project, I mainly worked on the signup page, edit profile page, list profile page, adding database data...

### Sign-up Page
When you sign up, you are asked to fill out a form with your name, email, password, bio, and interests (bio and interests are optional). The form is validated to ensure that all fields are filled out correctly. Once the form is submitted, the user is added to the database and redirected to the home page. Click on the images to view the source code!

### Edit Profile Page
The edit profile page allows users to update their profile information. Users can change their name, email, password, bio, interests, and also add a profile picture! The form is pre-filled with the user's current information, and users can update any fields as they wish. 


### List Profile Page
The list profile page displays a list of all users in the database. Each user is displayed with their name, email, bio, and interests. Users can click on a user's name to view their profile page. The list is paginated to display a limited number of users per page. Users can navigate through the list using the pagination buttons at the bottom of the page.
